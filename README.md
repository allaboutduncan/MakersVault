<h1>Makers Vault</h1>
<p>Makers Vault is a home for all your 3D print files and creative images/illustrations. Tired of having basic folders on your desktop filled with 3D print files with inconsistent names? Tired of having to load a 3D print file into your slicer just to see what it is? Look no further. Create folders, tag your files, and preview them in 3D directly in your browser. Makers Vault is fully self-hostable using Docker and accessible through your web browser for ease of use and deployment.</p>

```

<h3>Docker Pull</h3>

```bash
docker pull shotgunwilly555/makersvault-api:latest
docker pull shotgunwilly555/makersvault-web:latest

docker run -d --name mv-api -p 8000:8000 \
  -e AUTH_USERNAME=admin -e AUTH_PASSWORD=super-secret \
  shotgunwilly555/makersvault-api:latest

docker run -d --name mv-web -p 5173:5173 \
  -e VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 \
  shotgunwilly555/makersvault-web:latest

```

<h3>Setting up the .env file</h3>
<p>Setting up the .env file is important to define your environment variables. This file should be placed in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file and named <strong>.env</strong>. An example .env file is shown below:</p>

```dotenv
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
API_IMAGE=shotgunwilly555/makersvault-api:latest
WEB_IMAGE=shotgunwilly555/makersvault-web:latest
FILE_STORAGE=/app/storage
DB_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=super-secret
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-random-secret
AUTH_TOKEN_TTL=43200
```

<p>If you plan to run the Docker container on anything other than your local machine, you must update the .env file accordingly. For example, if you are running Makers Vault on a Linux server or behind a reverse proxy with a domain name:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you run Makers Vault on anything other than the local machine, you must change <code>CORS_ORIGINS</code>, <code>VITE_API_URL</code>, and <code>VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS</code> to the appropriate address, otherwise login requests can fail or the Vite dev server will refuse the connection.</p>

```dotenv
PUID=1000
PGID=1000
API_IMAGE=shotgunwilly555/makersvault-api:latest
WEB_IMAGE=shotgunwilly555/makersvault-web:latest
FILE_STORAGE=/app/storage
DB_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
CORS_ORIGINS=http://10.0.0.160:5173,https://makersvault-local.duckdns.org  # comma separate local + proxy entry points
VITE_API_URL=https://makersvault-local.duckdns.org  # browser should call the public/proxied URL
VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS=10.0.0.160,makersvault-local.duckdns.org  # hostnames only; keep in sync with CORS_ORIGINS
AUTH_USERNAME=admin
AUTH_PASSWORD=super-secret
AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-random-secret  # recommended to use a random generated string
AUTH_TOKEN_TTL=43200
```

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> <code>CORS_ORIGINS</code> accepts a comma-separated list so you can keep both your direct access URL (e.g. <code>http://10.0.0.160:5173</code>) and reverse proxy domain (e.g. <code>https://makersvault-local.duckdns.org</code>) in one .env file without rewriting it when you switch.</p>
<p>The Vite dev server now reads <code>VITE_ALLOWED_HOSTS</code> and will fall back to <code>CORS_ORIGINS</code> (plus the hostname from <code>VITE_API_URL</code>) if it is not provided, so host checks stay in sync with the API CORS settings without creating a manual <code>vite.config.js</code> inside the container.</p>
<p><strong>Running as non-root:</strong> set <code>PUID</code> and <code>PGID</code> to your host user/group IDs (defaults to 1000). The containers create a matching user at startup so volume mounts stay writable and <code>whoami</code> inside the container reports that user instead of root.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping the API internal:</strong> the web service must remain published for browsers, but the API port only needs to be published when you call it directly. When you front both services with a reverse proxy, remove the <code>ports</code> section from <code>api</code> and add <code>expose: ["8000"]</code> so it is reachable only on the Docker network.</p>

<p>By default, the username and password are defined in the .env file. It is recommended to change these credentials. All other variables can be modified based on user preference. When mapping ports in the docker-compose file, ensure the ports match the values set in the .env file.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create and delete folders.</li>
  <li>Tag any document uploaded to Makers Vault.</li>
  <li>Sort, search, and rename documents.</li>
  <li>Add notes to documents.</li>
  <li>Toggle between light and dark mode for better viewing of differently colored 3D models.</li>
  <li>Create username and password for added security when running behind a reverse proxy.</li>
  <li>Move or delete files from within the application.</li>
  <li>Drag and drop uploads and folder uploads.</li>
  <li>Customization themes.</li>
  <li>Open in Slicer (Beta).</li>
  <li>Import from link (MakerWorld, Thingiverse, and Printables).</li>
  <li>Batch tagging and batch deleting.</li>

<h2>UI and Feature Walkthrough</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For initial install instructions refer to the Getting Started section.</p>

<h3>Logging in for the First Time</h3>
<img width="1911" height="946" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c53c4f9-dbb2-4796-a80e-95dbbf62b3dc" />
<p>Log in using the default password set in the .env file, or a custom password if configured (recommended).</p>

<h3>Landing Page / All Items</h3>
<img width="1914" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a46a29f-0a3a-4281-b702-fbd8967698a6" />
<p>Since 3D print previews may be different colors (black, white, red, etc.), use the theme selector in the top right corner to switch between light and dark mode for better visibility.</p>
<img width="1908" height="938" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8b41985-0fe7-4a5a-8d47-24d5895e23f4" />

<h3>Uploading Files</h3>
<p>Makers Vault supports single-file uploads, batch uploads, folder uploads, and drag and drop. To upload a file, click the Upload button in the top-right corner. To upload a folder, use the Upload Folder button and select the entire folder. Dragged files upload to the currently selected folder.</p>
<img width="1901" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc40995c-81d2-4af2-a380-b3d85a0608bf" />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the number and size of the files, upload and preview generation may take some time. Please be patient.</p>
<img width="1892" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/461aefda-dbe0-4c39-99f0-32c974674c6b" />

<h3>Model Rendering, Tagging, and Adding Notes</h3>
<p>Makers Vault uses static 3D preview images in each tile to keep folder browsing fast. To view a fully interactive 3D preview, double-click the tile. In the pop-up window, you can rotate and inspect the 3D model interactively.</p>
<img width="1910" height="934" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c464fa1-2b94-4ca5-965d-af49cd0c8a38" />
<p>Individual files can be renamed by double-clicking the Name field. The file extension (STL, STEP, 3MF, etc.) will be preserved even if removed by mistake.</p>
<img width="320" height="426" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c711b258-f726-4a93-9950-09dd2261de59" />
<p>Add notes to a document from the file details panel to capture print settings, source links, or reminders.</p>

<h3>Importing via Link (Beta)</h3>
<p>The currently supported 3D printing repository sites are MakerWorld, Printables, and Thingiverse. Paste a model link into the import field.</p>
<p>Most models import as a .zip file. When a zip is imported, choose to save it as-is or unzip and select the files to keep.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> MakerWorld limits unauthenticated downloads. If imports are blocked, add your browser session cookie in Settings -&gt; Imports -&gt; MakerWorld (stored only in your browser).</p>

<h3>Tagging Files and Adding to Folders</h3>
<p>To begin organizing files, click "New" at the top left to create a new folder.</p>
<img width="1898" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731e596f-9eee-4911-b9b8-1d495faeb393" />
<p>After creating a folder, assign files to it using the dropdown menu in each file tile. Alternatively, click the folder and then upload files directly - uploaded files will automatically be placed in the current folder.</p>
<img width="1890" height="935" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8394c035-8554-4a3c-a33a-2b12c1015d0d" />
<img width="1896" height="943" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/177a74f4-19c1-409c-974e-e5a4f64f5d01" />
<img width="1909" height="927" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/609ff28c-dc4e-4c43-93ad-452d33e2a347" />
<p>When entering tags, typing a comma will close the current tag and allow you to enter the next. Example: typing "3D Print," will create a tag named "3D Print".</p>
<img width="1896" height="940" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ab01c9-1fd4-4a32-9613-7e36d978f245" />
<p>To sort by tags, click the matching tag tab at the top of the page. The sorting dropdown next to the search bar allows sorting by name, size, file type, and folder.</p>
<img width="1911" height="939" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ead40d63-b019-4f99-8daa-79c488b535c3" />
<img width="1912" height="925" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bf49efc-a110-4122-8669-6c8cbde4b6cf" />

<h3>Batch Tagging and Deleting</h3>
<p>The batch tagging and batch deleting feature uses the select toggle on each render tile. Apply a tag or delete from any selected tile and the action applies to all selected items.</p>

<h3>Open in Slicer (Beta)</h3>
<p>Select your slicer in Settings -&gt; Open in Slicer, then click Open in Slicer on a model tile. The button updates to match the chosen slicer. Open in Slicer requires the Slicer Bridge helper installed on the machine running the slicer.</p>

<h2>Slicer Bridge</h2>
<p>For the Open in Slicer feature to work, a standalone helper must be installed on any machine with a slicer installed (Windows or Linux).</p>
<p>Download the latest executable from the <a href="https://github.com/VincentCinque/MakersVault/releases/latest">Makers Vault releases</a> page and follow the setup steps in the <a href="makervault/slicer-bridge/README.md">Slicer Bridge README</a>.</p>
<p>Example: if you host Makers Vault on a Linux server but run your slicer on a Windows laptop, install the bridge on the Windows laptop only.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>The settings page is accessed from the settings button in the lower-left corner. The settings sub-menus include Open in Slicer, Themes, and Import settings.</p>

<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>The currently available themes are system default, light, dark, neon green, neon purple, and neon blue. The themes change page accents as well as the background color.</p>

<h3>Import Settings</h3>
<p>MakerWorld enforces a five-download limit if you are not logged in. This limits the amount of Import from Link requests unless you place a cookie session header in the import settings.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The cookie session header is stored only in the browser for security purposes. Never share this value with anyone and avoid storing it elsewhere that can easily be accessed by someone else.</p>

<h3>Finding the Cookie Session Header</h3>
<p><strong>Chrome / Edge</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign in to makerworld.com or thingiverse.com.</li>
  <li>Open DevTools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the Network tab.</li>
  <li>Reload the page to capture requests.</li>
  <li>Click a request to the site (Type: document or fetch/xhr).</li>
  <li>In Headers -&gt; Request Headers, copy the value of <code>Cookie</code> (everything after <code>Cookie:</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Firefox</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign in to makerworld.com or thingiverse.com.</li>
  <li>Open DevTools (F12), choose Network, and reload the page.</li>
  <li>Select a request to the site and open the Headers panel.</li>
  <li>Under Request Headers, copy the <code>Cookie</code> value (right-click -&gt; Copy Value).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> MakerWorld cookies often include <code>mw_session</code> and <code>mw_token</code>. Thingiverse cookies often include <code>cf_clearance</code> and <code>PHPSESSID</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Cookies expire. If imports fail later, repeat these steps to refresh the cookie.</p>
